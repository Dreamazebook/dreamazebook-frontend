        The heart of Dreamaze is simple:<br/>
        <b>everyone deserves to be the hero of their own story.</b><br/>
        As a mother I witnessed the pure joy on my daughter&apos;s face when she saw herself in a bookâ€”a unique experience she had never had before.<br/>
        We believe personalized books should go beyond pieced-together avatars to create immersive experiences where<br/>
        <b>you or your loved ones are the true protagonists.</b>
